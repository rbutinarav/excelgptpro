# excelgptpro

## Overview

Welcome to the initial, early-stage release of excelgptpro! This Excel add-in aims to bring the power of OpenAI to your spreadsheets. Currently, excelgptpro is under active development and is in a very early stage. This means that while it's functional, it's expected to have bugs and may not have all features implemented yet.

The purpose of excelgptpro is to streamline your workload, offering sophisticated AI capabilities directly within Excel, and potentially saving you time and effort on various tasks.

## Current Features

In its current early development stage, excelgptpro introduces initial support for the following features:

- **Translate Text:** Translate text between languages directly within Excel. (In progress)
- **Extract Text:** Use AI to extract relevant information from your textual data. (Coming soon)
- **Summarize Text:** Convert lengthy paragraphs into concise summaries. (Coming soon)

We are actively working on these features and expect improvements and more stability in the coming releases.

## Future Releases

We're constantly working to improve and expand excelgptpro. Planned features for future releases include:

- **Formula Suggestions:** Get AI-driven suggestions to solve both simple and complex Excel formulas. This feature is currently in the design phase and we hope to start development soon.

## Getting Started
